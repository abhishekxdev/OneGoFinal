-- Fix Authentication Configuration
-- This script helps configure Supabase for password-based authentication

-- 1. Check current authentication settings
SELECT '=== CURRENT AUTH SETTINGS ===' as status;

-- Note: Most auth settings are configured in Supabase Dashboard, not via SQL
-- This script will help you understand what needs to be configured

-- 2. Check if there are any auth-related functions
SELECT '=== CHECKING AUTH FUNCTIONS ===' as status;

SELECT 
  routine_name, 
  routine_type,
  data_type
FROM information_schema.routines 
WHERE routine_name LIKE '%auth%' OR routine_name LIKE '%user%'
ORDER BY routine_name;

-- 3. Check auth.users table structure (if accessible)
SELECT '=== CHECKING AUTH.USERS TABLE ===' as status;

SELECT 
  column_name,
  data_type,
  is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'users' AND table_schema = 'auth'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- 4. Check if there are any auth policies
SELECT '=== CHECKING AUTH POLICIES ===' as status;

SELECT 
  schemaname,
  tablename,
  policyname,
  permissive,
  roles,
  cmd
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE schemaname = 'auth'
ORDER BY tablename, policyname;

SELECT '=== AUTHENTICATION CONFIGURATION GUIDE ===' as status;
